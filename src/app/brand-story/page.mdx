# Brand Story

Voltic's story began with a spark â€“ an idea that commercial vehicles could be both powerful and planet-friendly. Our founders, a team of engineers and environmentalists, saw the untapped potential in the commercial EV space and set out to create a company that would lead the industry's transformation. From our first prototype to our latest product line, our journey has been fueled by a commitment to excellence and a desire to make a lasting impact on the world.
